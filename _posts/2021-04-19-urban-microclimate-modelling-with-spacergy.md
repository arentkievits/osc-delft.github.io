“Developing a climate model is challenging, time-consuming and the data often requires a large amount of storage space. By publishing our data in 4TU.ResearchData we have ensured secure and long-term preservation of our datasets without concerns about storage,” says Daniela Maiullari, a PhD candidate at the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft.
