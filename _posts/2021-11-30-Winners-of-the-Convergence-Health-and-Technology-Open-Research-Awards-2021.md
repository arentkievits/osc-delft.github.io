*Recognising early career researchers in health and technology practising open research.*

In 2021 we launched the [Convergence Health and Technology Open Research Award](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts/2021/06/21/Convergence-Health-and-Technology-Awards/), which was a collaborative effort between the [Convergence Alliance](http://www.convergencealliance.nl/), [Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club](https://www.riotsciencenl.com/), [Open Science Community Rotterdam](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/), and [Open Science Community Delft](https://osc-delft.github.io). These awards are aimed at rewarding researchers who are adopting open research practices in healthcare and technology. Open research practices improve transparency, openness, reproducibility, and replicability, essential to achieving quality research.

We received many wonderful nominations, a testament of the fact that open science practices are becoming mainstream. Many thanks to all nominees and nominators!

We had the pleasure to award 12 outstanding researchers – working at Erasmus MC, Erasmus University Rotterdam, and TU Delft – who demonstrated great commitment to open research in several ways, from excellent preregistrations to publicly shared software and datasets:
- Martijn Starmans (ErasmusMC)
- Kimberlijn van Wijnen (ErasmusMC)
- Sebastiaan van der Voort (ErasmusMC)
- Brandon Rasman (ErasmusMC)
- Anne Bülow (EUR)
- Max Welz (EUR)
- Michelle Achterberg (EUR)
- Jannis Stöckel & Sebastian Himmler (EUR)
- Qian He (TU Delft)
- Joris Verhagen (TU Delft)
- Leila Iñigo de la Cruz (TU Delft)
- Pavlo Bazilinskyy (TU Delft)
