Would you like to:
- Connect with and gain visibility within a network of open science enthusiasts in TU Delft, the Netherlands, and beyond?
- Use your creative and organisation skills to shape open science dialogues?
- Learn more about open science and its relationship with Artificial Intelligence, Climate & sustainability, recognition & reward, and more?

This is a unique opportunity for you!

*Update 19/11/21: Due to scheduling clashes and a tight timeline, this event has now been postponed to May/June 2022. This allows more time for our community members and organising teams to design a more comprehensive, inspiring event!*

The Open Science Community Delft, together with the TU Delft Open Science Programme, are planning **a 2-day open science event in the first week of November, 2021, with and for TUD researchers and teachers**.

Aims of the event:
- Recognise TUD scholars for their contribution towards and participation in open science
- Stimulate discussions and generate interest around open science in different domains of research, e.g. Artificial Intelligence, climate and sustainability, design, and health
- Connect TUD research and teaching communities with policymakers and support staff to create a shared vision towards open science at TU Delft

To build this event with the community, we will open a call for session proposals at the beginning of July to allow our community to submit their session ideas.

## We need you in the organising committee!

We are forming an organising team for the event, and we'd like to invite you to participate! You can join as a member of the programme, communications or logistics team.

Some tasks and time commitment for team members are laid out below:

- Programme team
  - Design scope of sessions
  - Design submission form
  - Design evaluation criteria for session submissions and evaluate submissions
  - Decide on programme (what happens when)
  - Support session hosts
- Communications team
  - Build communication plan
  - Design messages (for different audiences)
  - Produce promotional materials (webpage, template emails, social graphics)
  - Spread the word
  - Session hosts and registrants communication
- Logistics team
  - Arrange virtual spaces (Zoom, live stream, discussion/chat channels); if In person, then physical spaces + catering
  - Design and implement registration form
  - Support session hosts with their logistical requirements (e.g. do they need whiteboarding tools? Audio/visual tests?)
  - Schedule rehearsal sessions

We expect that team members will spend *60-90 mins/week* from May to October on event organisation (more in the month prior to the event).

Would you like to join? Please let community coordinator [Emmy](mailto:f.tsang@tudelft.nl) know.
