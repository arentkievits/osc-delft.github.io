- title: "Plan S Ask-me-anything (AMA)"
  date_time: 3 x 1hr sessions
  location: Online through Zoom
  content: |
        Beginning 2021, funders who support [Plan S](https://www.openaccess.nl/nl/in-nederland/plan-s) worldwide, including NWO, the European Commission and ERC, will adopt new open access publishing mandates for their grantees. At these AMA sessions, Just de Leeuwe (Publishing advisor, TU Delft library) will explain how this may impact researchers' publishing strategy and answer your questions regarding Plan S.

        These sessions have now been postponed to Fall/Winter 2021. If you have questions regarding Plan S, please contact the library at library [at] tudelft [nl] - we're more than happy to hear from you!
