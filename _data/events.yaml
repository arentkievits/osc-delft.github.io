- title: "Open Science Coffee: Diversity & Inclusion in Research, Technology and Design"
  date_time: Wednesday, October 6, 12:45-1:45pm CEST
  location: Online through Zoom ([register here](https://tudelft.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtcOCsrj8qGtRXTxv86bSZKOe_EQ_D_5cF))

        TU Delft researchers are designing and engineering technologies, systems and frameworks that aim to solve some of the biggest global challenges, from climate change to health. At the same time, we see new technologies causing unwarranted consequences that often fall on minorities and the most vulnerable in our society. Our society is increasingly losing trust in "experts". Our research environments are built for the elite and wealthy, systemically excluding the under-represented. While "open science" and "team science" climb on the agendas of organisations from UNESCO to the Dutch National Funder NWO, are our research, engineering and design processes open for all to participate? Who is missing from our conversations and processes and how does this impact our work? How do we ensure that our work can truly be *global, collaborative and open*?

        Our 3 invited panellists will share their experience and lead the discussion:
          - Eriol Fox: Product manager/design for open-source tools & PhD Candidate, Open Lab Newcastle
          - David Selassie Opoku: Co-founder & Farmer, Growing Gold Farms
          - Roberto Rocco: Associate Professor in Spatial Planning and Strategy, TU Delft

        This event is open to all members and non-members - [**register here to participate**](https://tudelft.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtcOCsrj8qGtRXTxv86bSZKOe_EQ_D_5cF)

        The session will also be recorded - a summary and recording will be shared on our [Stories page](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts) shortly after the event.



- title: "Open Science Coffee: Research Code Review"
  date_time: Wednesday, September 1, 2021, 10-11am CEST
  location: Online through Zoom

        More researchers are writing code to process, analyse and visualise their data. For reproducible and robust research, it is increasingly important that this code is reviewed.

        Join this inaugural Open Science Coffee to learn more and discuss best practices, challenges and opportunities in reviewing research code. Our 3 invited panellists with share their experience and perspectives with participants:
          - Anton Akhmerov: Associate Professor, Department of Quantum Nanoscience & Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU delft
          - Stephen Eglen: Professor of Computational Neuroscience, University of Cambridge & Co-Founder, [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk)
          - Djura Smits: Research Software Engineer, Netherlands eScience Center

        We will also discuss the latest developments in code reviewing practices. We're excited to hear your questions and thoughts!

        The session has now completed - [a recording and summary](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts/2021/09/03/Research-Code-Review/) is available.
