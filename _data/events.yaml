- title: "Software Policy and Guidelines: Information session for research support staff"

        The newly drafted TU Delft Research Software Policy and new Guidelines set out a simplified, streamlined process to help researchers to manage and share their software.

        The proposed workflow is easy to adopt with a clear division of roles and responsibilities that simplify the organization and (open) sharing of research software. Where previously a lengthy process was required, now, with the introduction of pre-approved licences and software registration, it is easier to comply with copyright rules. The policy and guidelines also offer clarity for researchers with contract and patent intentions.

        TU Delft staff in supporting roles related to Research Software (e.g. data stewards, contract managers, data managers, research software engineers, faculty information managers, etc.) are invited to join this information session.

        In this session, Dr. Merlijn Bazuine from TU Delft Legal Office (Valorisation Centre) will go through the following topics:

        - Why a research software policy?
        - What does this policy is/is not?
        - Benefits of the new workflow
        - How to follow the workflow?
        - Where to get help?

        An extended part of the session will be dedicated to answer questions.

        Beginning 2021, funders who support [Plan S](https://www.openaccess.nl/nl/in-nederland/plan-s) worldwide, including NWO, the European Commission and ERC, will adopt new open access publishing mandates for their grantees. At these AMA sessions, Just de Leeuwe (Publishing advisor, TU Delft library) will explain how this may impact researchers' publishing strategy and answer your questions regarding Plan S.

        These sessions have now been postponed to Fall/Winter 2021. If you have questions regarding Plan S, please contact the library at library [at] tudelft [nl] - we're more than happy to hear from you!
