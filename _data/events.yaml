        TU Delft researchers are designing and engineering technologies, systems and frameworks that aim to solve some of the biggest global challenges, from climate change to health. At the same time, we see new technologies causing unwarranted consequences that often fall on minorities and the most vulnerable in our society. Our society is increasingly losing trust in "experts". Our research environments are built for the elite and wealthy, systemically excluding the under-represented. While "open science" and "team science" climb on the agendas of organisations from UNESCO to the Dutch National Funder NWO, are our research, engineering and design processes open for all to participate? Who is missing from our conversations and processes and how does this impact our work? How do we ensure that our work can truly be *global, collaborative and open*?

        Our 3 invited panellists will share their experience and lead the discussion:
          - Eriol Fox: Product manager/designer for open-source tools & PhD Candidate at Open Lab Newcastle
          - David Selassie Opoku: Farmer at Growing Gold Farms & Fellow at Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab
          - Roberto Rocco: Associate Professor in Spatial Planning and Strategy at TU Delft

        This event is open to all members and non-members - [**register here to participate**](https://tudelft.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtcOCsrj8qGtRXTxv86bSZKOe_EQ_D_5cF)

        A summary of the session will be shared on our [Stories page](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts) shortly after the event.
