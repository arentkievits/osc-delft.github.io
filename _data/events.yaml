        More researchers are writing code to process, analyse and visualise their data. For reproducible and robust research, it is increasingly important that this code is reviewed.

        Join this inaugural Open Science Coffee to learn more and discuss best practices, challenges and opportunities in reviewing research code. Our 3 invited panellists with share their experience and perspectives with participants:
          - Anton Akhmerov: Associate Professor, Department of Quantum Nanoscience & Kavli institute of Nanoscience, TU delft
          - Stephen Eglen: Professor of Computational Neuroscience, University of Cambridge & Co-Founder, [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk)
          - Djura Smits: Research Software Engineer, Netherlands eScience Center

        We will also discuss the latest developments in code reviewing practices. We're excited to hear your questions and thoughts!

        This event is open to all members and non-members - [**register here to participate**](https://tudelft.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwtcOypqzwpHNZPRVlObq8dK_DIGy0yWLrs)

        Beginning 2021, funders who support [Plan S](https://www.openaccess.nl/nl/in-nederland/plan-s) worldwide, including NWO, the European Commission and ERC, will adopt new open access publishing mandates for their grantees. At these AMA sessions, Just de Leeuwe (Publishing advisor, TU Delft library) will explain how this may impact researchers' publishing strategy and answer your questions regarding Plan S.

        These sessions have now been postponed to Fall/Winter 2021. If you have questions regarding Plan S, please contact the library at library [at] tudelft [nl] - we're more than happy to hear from you!
